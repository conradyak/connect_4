# connect_4
A repo of Guy Brown's connect 4 web game for GA WDI course.  Bacon 4 life!


  In my connect four game I wanted to build was hallowen themed and call-back to the early 2000's browers games I used play in the back of class in high school.  The vision I had led me build an HTML with many divs, these included the main div(container) in the center that was the parent for the game pieces.  On the sides are to column divs that contain the palyer avatars, below is the scoreboard div with the start button, and player name inputs and the score counter.  To do this I researched HTML orginization tips for more advance layout and looked at CSS tips.  This helped me link a full picture background, and insert .gifs for the avatars.  I taged and labled all the properties in my HTML, thinking this would make this use the DOM...
  
  I wired out my plan of how to make the small divs into arrays and push them into the columns, have click events on the columns which would push the value into the small div array and then the value would set the css selector for color.  I was able to push a value into the array but since the id's were unique I was only to target one column and push the color into that specific array.  I tried run loops that were nested for each column it seemed the damage was done.  I either kept bashing it or getting the same result, so I created a new branch and tried to edit the HTML so I could access with better results.  That was going better with jQuery but ran in to the deadline and had to prep the orginal version for publishing.  
  
  I had my theory and arrays build up to check for but I never got to them other than constructing them and I am not sure if they ever would have been viable with a redo on the DOM control.  I was also having difficulties attaching a listener event to my button but in the grand scheme of difficulties I had that was down there.
